### restore the environment's health to maximum in the least generations to win game

Civilisation slowly declined and vanished as soil fertility was completely depleated from over farming, pollutants and global industrial scale monocrop agriculture.

Restore the your tribe's land to maximum fertility in the least generations to win the game.

**You can do this by**
  - only harvesting what plants and hunting what animals your tribe needs
  - planting different plants
    - each plant has varing effects on the soil
    - some are deep rooting an will extract deeply locked nutrients to the surface
    - some provide shade or other plants to grow
    - some provide more food for more animals to grow
  - creating compost
    - add animal remains
    - add used vegetable matter
    - add deceased tribe members
  - fending off neighbouring tribes who wish to re-establish agriculture or herding on your land
  - adding neighbouring tribe's cattle / sheep / goats to your compost if they stray onto your land
