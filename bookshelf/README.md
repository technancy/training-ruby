# Bookshelf

The company library has a great range of technical books, and the team are
encouraged to make good use of them.

Unfortunately it's very easy for someone to borrow a book, take it home,
and forget they still have it. This prevents others from making use of
the book, or even knowing that it's available in the library.

To help make best use of the library we want to build a system that

  * enables the team to find relevant books from the library
  * helps the team locate books that aren't on the shelf
